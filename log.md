### Day 2: Wednesday, October 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Javascript 30 CSS Clock!
**TIL**:
 - The Date() function in Javascript and how it returns an object where we can access the current date and time.
 - How to convert seconds, minutes and hours to degrees and apply that to a transform rotate.
 - How to pass an argument to the setInterval function so that the function runs every interval which in this case is every second.

**Thoughts** 
I think it will be super useful to know how to leverage the Date()
